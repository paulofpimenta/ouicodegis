		<p><strong>Not so brieflly about me</strong></p>
		<p>My name is Paulo Pimenta, an unconventional software developer. If you are on my web page, it is because you too are unique.</p>

		<p>I believe in knowledge societies, based on sharing, dissemination, and promotion of know-how with superiors,
			teammates, and the public. Therefore, this blog is just one manner of sharing my passion for computer science and GIS with you,
			and the other way is by engaging me as a full-stack software developer. My professional experience ranges from
			land use and land cover change modeling, spatial health informatics, to model-driven agent-based modeling.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Why this blog</strong> </p>
		<p>I am a computer scientist currently living in Montpellier, France. I am a full-stack developer with an emphasis on 
			geographic information system (GIS) technologies.I enjoy working with Python and Django.
