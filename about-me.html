				<p><strong>Not so brieflly about me</strong> </p>
					<p>My name is Paulo Pimenta and I am not an ordinary software developper. If you clicked here I believe you wanted to know more about me
					and you want now know why I consider myself a no ordinary software developper. To answer these two questions, I will start 
					from the end: the reason why I created this blog.</p>
					
					<p>I always liked to help people, sharing my knowledge whatever team I would be part of. As much I have learned from my collegues,
					I have always wanted to give it back. If not directly to people that helped me, then, to others. I also enjoy writting, so I decided to create this blog to practice my writting skills.
					blog to practice my english writting skillls. By the way, I suppose that, at this point, you have already noticed that I am not a native English writter.</p>
					
					<p>An how did I get here ? Well, I failed the exams to enter to medicine school. Only to realize later, in 1999, that my interests 
					towards computers were much greater than my those about the human body. Hopefully I decided to follow my intuintion an I went to 
					collegue, to pursue an information systems degree. I dived in the world of computers, programming languages and networks. 
					I have learned that computer science is very useful (and profits from) on solving problems found in other sciences. Living in the Amazon 
					region on that time, led me to believe that computer science applied to envinroment could be an interesting starting field to help
					some common evenrironmental issues that we encounter in that region. The day I was lectured about geographic information systems just 
					reinforced what I believed. And that is where my story with GIS begins.</p>
					
					<p>I had professional experience as a software developer for both web and desktop platforms. My focus was alaywas GIS. Later, I dediced to
					start my masters in the wondeful world of modelling, focusing on land use and land cover modelling. As my interest about modelling grew stronger,
					I have also noticed that modelling was like a black box to novices. Thus, I wanted to help decreasing the distance between modelling tools and
					normal non-programmer users. That said, I decided to move to Montpellier (France), and pursue a PhD at the University of Montpelier. During my PhD, 
					I used software engineering aproach called Model Driven Engineer (MDE). I used MDE to develop a programming language called B-Reactive, a language to specify reactive behaviour in multi-agent
                    systems. After I graduated from my PhD, I started to dive in the wonderful world of Python. I was, naturally,
                    led to search for Python applications in modelling and web development, such as Scikit Learn and Django.
					Continously learning, my goals are to use my skills in the domain of GIS, web developpment and modelling.
