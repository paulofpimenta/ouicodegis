				<p><strong>Not so brieflly about me</strong> </p>
					<p>My name is Paulo Pimenta, an uncoventional software developper. If you are on my web page, it is because you too are special.</p>
					
					<p>I always liked to help people, sharing my knowledge with whatever team I would be part of. As much I have learned from my collegues,
					I have always wanted to give it back. If not directy to the people that helped me, then, to others. I also enjoy writting, so I decided 
					to create this blog to practice my english writting skillls. By the way, I suppose that at this point, you have already noticed that I am 
					not a native English writter.</p>
					
					<p>But how did I get here ? Well, after failing the entry exams at the Medical faculty, I noticed, around 1999, that my interests towards computers
					were much greater than my those about the human body. Hopefully I declined my efforts to get to and decided to follow my true passion.
					I went to collegue of information systems and I dived in the world of computers, programming languages and networks. 
					I have learned that if computer science is, and should be usefull only if it is able to solve a problem. Moreover, living in the Amazon region
					on that time, led me to believe that computer science applied to environnment could be a new field  to explore. And the day I was 
					lectured about geographic information systems (GIS) reinforced what I believed. That is where my story with GIS begins.</p>
					
					<p>My professional experience as a softawre developer are both for web and desktop platforms. But because my focus was always GIS, I dediced to
					to take a step futher and start my masters. My masters was about land use and land cover change modelling. As my interest about modelling grew stronger,
					I have also noticed that modelling was like a black block to noviced, so I wanted to help to decrease this distance between modelling tools and
					normal non-programmer users. So I decided to move to Montpellier, in France, and pursue a PhD at the University of Montpelier. During my PhD, 
					I used software engineering aproach called Model Driven Engineer (MDE). I used MDE to develop a programming language called B-Reactive, a language to specify reactive behaviour in multi-agent
					systems. After I graduated from my PhD, I started to dive in the wonderful world of Python. I was naturally drived to 
					search for Python applications in modelling and web development, such as Scikit Learn and Django.Continously learning, 
					my goals are to use my skills in the domain of GIS, web developpment and modelling.
